# Data_elephant_grass_HTP
The experimental data for this study were obtained from multiple environmental trials of elephant grass clones grown for bioenergy purposes.
The study was conducted between 2015 and 2018 in six environments by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). 
The evaluated trait was total dry biomass (Mg ha− 1 year− 1), and the trials were composed of 21 clones planted in rectangular plots 
(1.2 × 4.0 m), consisting of three rows planted side by side in a randomized block design with three replications. 
Clones 19 (BRS Canará) and 20 (BRS Capiaçu) are commercial clones that were used as checks on the trails. 
The genotypes were planted in 0.20 m deep furrows, and fertilizer was applied at planting according to the soil analysis. 
The maintenance fertilizer was applied at a rate of 300 kg ha−1 year−1 N-P2O5-K2O (20:05:20 blended granular fertilizer) in all
environments after each evaluation cutting. However, the dataset produced by these trials was highly unbalanced because not all 
genotypes were planted in all environments.
